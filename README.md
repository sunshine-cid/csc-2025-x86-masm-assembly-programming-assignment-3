x86 MASM 10-Week Condensed College Course CSC-2025 this is the third programming assignment

----------

Part 1: Syntax Understanding

  1. (4 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, define four symbolic constants that represent integer 42 in decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats.
  
  2. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, create a data definition for a doubleword that stored it in memory in big endian format.
  
  3. (3 Pts) Find out if you can declare a variable of type DWORD and assign it a negative value. What does this tell you about the assembler’s type checking?
  
  4. (3 Pts) Given the number 456789ABh, list out its byte values in little-endian order.
  
  5. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare an array of 225 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values.
  
  6. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare an array of byte and initialize it to the last 10 letters of the alphabet.
  
  7. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare a 32-bit signed integer variable and initialize it with the smallest possible negative decimal value.
  
  8. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare an unsigned 16-bit integer variable named wArray that uses five initializers.
  
  9. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare a string variable containing the name of your favorite color. Initialize it as a null terminated string.
  
  10. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare an uninitialized array of 75 signed doublewords named d_Array.
  
  11. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare a string variable containing the word “SKIP” repeated 250 times.
  
  12. (3 Pts) Using 32-bit MASM x86 Assembly syntax, declare an array of 45 unsigned bytes named bArray and initialize all elements to zero.
  
  13. (3 Pts) Show the order of individual bytes in memory (lowest to highest) for the following double-word variable: val1 DWORD 87654321h

  Solutions must be typed and syntax must be formatted appropriately.

Part 2: Programming Exercises

  1. (20 Pts) Using the AddTwo program from Section 3.2 as a reference, write a program that calculates the following expression, using registers: A = (A + B) − (C + D). Assign integer values A, B, C, D to the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers, registers
respectively.
  
  2. (20 Pts) Write a program that contains a definition of each data type listed in Table 3-2 in Section 3.4. Initialize each variable to a value that is consistent with its data type. Perform an operation with at least 4 of the data types. Indicate the expected result of each operation in the comments.
  
  3. (20 Pts) Write a program that defines symbolic names for several string literals (characters between quotes). Use each symbolic name in a variable definition.
